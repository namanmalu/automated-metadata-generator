Hi, this is a quick demo of the Automated Metadata Generator web app.

1. Open the app using: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Upload your .docx file.
3. The app will display metadata like title, authors, keywords, etc.
4. This helps in automating the document classification and discovery process.

Thank you!
